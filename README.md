Task: Weather App

Objective: Build a web page that fetches weather data from a weather API based on the user's location or a user-inputted location. Display the current weather conditions, temperature, and other relevant information.

Requirements:

1. User Location or Inputted Location
  The web page should be able to fetch the user's current location using geolocation API or allow the user to input a location manually.
   The location can be in the form of city, state, country, or zip code.

2. Weather API Integration
   The web page should integrate with a weather API to fetch the current weather data for the user's location or inputted location.
   The API should provide data on current weather conditions, temperature, and other relevant information.

3. Display Weather Information
    The web page should display the following information:
    Current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.)
    Temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit)
   Other relevant information (e.g., humidity, wind speed, etc.)

4. User Interface
   The web page should have a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily input their location or select their current location.
   The interface should display the weather information in a clear and concise manner.

5. Error Handling
   The web page should handle errors gracefully, such as:
   API errors or downtime
   User input errors (e.g., invalid location)
   Geolocation errors (e.g., user denies access to location)
 
 Deliverables:

A functional web page that meets the above requirements
A brief report explaining the implementation details, including the weather API used and any challenges faced during development

Evaluation Criteria:

Correctness and completeness of the implementation
User experience and interface design
Error handling and robustness
Code quality and organization
